            <p>
                Any modifications or repairs must be performed by qualified personnel only.<br />Do not heat food or liquids sealed in containers for the microwave function.<br />
                Do not use benzene, thinner, alcohol, or steam or high-pressure cleaners to clean the oven.<br />Do not install the oven: near a heater or flammable material; locations that are
                humid, oily, dusty or exposed to direct sunlight or water; or where gas may leak;or an uneven surface.<br />
                This oven must be properly grounded in accordance with local and national codes.<br />Regularly use a dry cloth to remove foreign substances from the power plug
                terminals and contacts.<br />Do not pull, excessively bend, or place heavy objects on the power cord.<br />
                If there is a gas leak (propane, LP, etc) ventilate immediately. Do not touch the power cord.<br /> Do not touch the power cord with wet hands.<br />
                While the oven is operating, do not turn it off by unplugging the power cord.<br />Do not insert fingers or foreign substances. If foreign substances enter the oven,<br />
                unplug the power cord and contact a local Samsung service centre.<br />Do not apply excessive pressure or impact to the oven.<br />Do not place the oven over fragile objects.<br />
                Ensure the power voltage, frequency, and current matches the product specifications.<br />
                Firmly plug the power plug into the wall socket. Do not use multiple plug adapters, extension cords, or electric transformers.<br />
                Do not hook the power cord on metal objects. Make sure the cord is between objects or behind the oven.<br />
                Do not use a damaged power plug, power cord, or loose wall socket. For damaged power plugs or cords, contact a local Samsung service centre.<br />
                Do not pour or directly spray water onto the oven.<br />Do not place objects on the oven, inside, or on the oven door.<br />
                Do not spray volatile materials such as insecticide on the oven.<br />
                Do not store flammable materials in the oven. Because alcohol vapours can contact hot parts of the oven, use caution when heating food or drinks containing alcohol.<br />
                Children may bump themselves or catch their fingers on the door. When opening/closing the door, keep children away.
            </p><br />

            <p><b>Microwave warning</b></p>
            <p>
                Microwave heating of beverages may result in delayed eruptive boiling; always use caution when handling the container.
                Always allow beverages to stand at least 20 seconds before handling. If necessary, stir during heating. Always stir after heating.
            </p>

            <p>In the event of scalding, follow these First Aid instructions:</p>
            <ol class="top-10" start="1">
                <li>Immerse the scalded area in cold water for at least 10 minutes.</li>
                <li>Cover with a clean, dry dressing.</li>
                <li>Do not apply any creams, oils, or lotions.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>To avoid damaging the tray or rack, do not put the tray or rack in water shortly after cooking.</p>
            <p>Do not use the oven for deep fat frying because the oil temperature cannot be controlled. This could result in a sudden boil over of hot oils.</p><br />

            <p><b>Microwave oven precautions</b></p>

            <p>
                Only use microwave-safe utensils. Do not use metallic containers, gold or silver trimmed dinnerware, skewers, etc. <br />Remove wire twist ties. Electric arcing may occur. <br />
                Do not use the oven to dry papers or clothes. <br />Use shorter times for small amounts of food to prevent overheating or burning. <br />
                Keep the power cord and power plug away from water and heat sources. <br />To avoid the risk of explosion, do not heat eggs with shells or hard-boiled eggs.
                Do not heat airtight or vacuum-sealed containers, nuts, tomatoes, etc. <br />Do not cover the ventilation slots with cloth or paper. This is a fire hazard.
                The oven may overheat and turn off automatically and will remain off until it cools sufficiently. <br />Always use oven mitts when removing a dish. <br />
                Stir liquids halfway during heating or after heating ends and allow the liquid stand at least 20 seconds after heating to prevent eruptive boiling. <br />
                Stand at arms length from the oven when opening the door to avoid getting scalded by escaping hot air or steam. <br />
                Do not operate the oven when it is empty. The oven will automatically shut down for 30 minutes for safety purposes.
                We recommend placing a glass of water inside the oven at all times to absorb microwave energy in case the oven is started accidentally.<br />
                Install the oven in compliance with the clearances in this manual. (See Installing your microwave oven.) <br />
                Use caution when connecting other electrical appliances to sockets near the oven.
